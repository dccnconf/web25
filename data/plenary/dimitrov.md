title: "THE ALMOST LACK OF MEMORY (ALM) DISTRIBUTIONS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS"
---

Long ago baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789 - 1857) proved in 1821 that if the functional
equation $f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)$ holds for any non-negative arguments $x$ and $y$, then the function
$f(x)$ exponential $f(x)=e^{cx}$ function. When applied to the probability property of a random
lifetime of a technical unit $X$ it looks $P\{X \ge x+y\}= P \{X \ge x\}P\{X \ge y\}$. From Kaushy theorem and
Probability it follows that the lifetime probability distribution function has the form $F \{X \ge' x\}= 1 - e^{-ax}$.
And it follows that if this unit still works (is alive at age $y$), the chances to stay alive
some more time x, is the same as when just starts functioning:
$P\{X \ge x+y | X \ge y \}= P\{X \ge x\}$.

A conventional reading of this property is known as Lack-of-Memory (LM) property at any age
$y$. It means that at any age y the units with exponentially distributed lifetimes lose the
memory about their current age and behave as a just newborn. This is a characteristic
property that helps in practice to recognize the lifetime distribution of technical items.

In a series of works with numerous colleagues (please, see the references) on similar
properties that may be used in practice to recognize the lifetime distribution of technical
items. And we found that if a lifetime shows the lack of memory at a given age c.

It will lose the memory at any age mc integer multiple to the constant c for infinitely many
times $m=2,3, 4,â€¦$. For this reason, we named these distributions ALM distributions. And we
found the mathematical form of this class of probability distributions, established numerous
mathematical presentations, physical properties, and found various practical applications.
