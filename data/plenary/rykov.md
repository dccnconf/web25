title: "Marked Markov Processes and Their Applications"
---
It appears that A.N. Kolmogorov was the first to use the term "processes with discrete random intervention (PDRI)." This terminology has been adopted by Yu.A. Rozanov [1], A.N. Shiryaev [2], and several other authors. However, references to the first mention of this term and its definition (even informal) could not be found. A conceptually similar notion is used by several foreign authors under the name "Discrete Event System (DES) modeling" [3].
As a mathematical framework for studying such systems, Generalized Semi-Markov Processes (GSMP) have been proposed [4]. These processes enable the analysis of many real-world stochastic systems. However, their structure is sufficiently complex and does not always allow for practical numerical analysis or result visualization.
This talk formalizes the PDRI concept and proposes its mathematical model as Marked Markov Processes (MMP) in the specific case when intervention times are generated by a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. Examples are provided demonstrating the application of MMPs to describe various systems in queuing theory, reliability theory, inventory control, warranty analysis, and other fields, along with results of their numerical analysis.
