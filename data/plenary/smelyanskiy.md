title: "Computing Centric Network â€” Next Generation Computing Infrastructure"
---
The architecture of next-generation computing infrastructure is presented, enabling the implementation of "computing on demand" services. 
A comparison is made with the GRID computing concept, highlighting the key challenges in its implementation. 
The necessity of applying machine learning methods to overcome these limitations through automated optimal decision-making is demonstrated. 
As a primary solution, a combination of software-defined networking (SDN), service virtualization, multi-agent optimization, and reinforcement learning is proposed. 
The novelty of this approach lies in self-organizing resource distribution without centralized control. 
Experiments show that the proposed method reduces task allocation time by $20-30%$ compared to traditional approaches and ensures uniform channel utilization (load variation coefficient $< 15%$). 
Thus, the effectiveness of ML-based decentralized management is confirmed.
